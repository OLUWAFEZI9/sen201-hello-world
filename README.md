SDLC Explanation
Project Title: Student Result Management System
1. Requirement Analysis
This phase involves identifying what the system is expected to do.
The Student Result Management System is designed to collect student information and scores, compute the average score, and display the result.
Functional requirements:
The system should accept a student’s name.
The system should accept three subject scores.
The system should calculate the average score.
The system should display the student name and average score.
Non-functional requirements:
The system should be simple and easy to use.
The system should run efficiently on a computer system.
2. System Design
In this phase, the structure of the system is planned before coding begins.
The system design consists of:
Input module: collects student name and scores.
Processing module: calculates the average score.
Output module: displays the student result.
The program will use variables to store data and basic arithmetic operations for processing.
3. Implementation
This phase involves writing the actual code based on the system design.
The project is implemented using Python programming language.
The file name used is student_result_system.py.
The variable names and logic used in the code directly reflect the design specifications.
4. Testing
Testing is carried out to ensure the system works correctly.
Test cases include:
Entering valid numerical scores to confirm correct average calculation.
Checking that the correct student name and result are displayed.
The system produces correct output when valid inputs are provided.
5. Deployment
After successful testing, the program is deployed by saving it as a Python file and uploading it to a GitHub repository.
This makes the project accessible online for submission and review.
6. Maintenance
Maintenance involves improving the system after deployment.
Possible future enhancements include:
Adding grade classification (A, B, C, etc.).
Storing student results in a file or database.
Improving the user interface.
